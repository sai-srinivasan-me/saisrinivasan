            <div class="container_fill_body">
                <p>
                    No one has had a life that is more challenging than mine yet I was able to still ram past the obstacles. I always want
                    to run my own business that fixes a world problem that everyone has been fighting to fix. My goals are to be successful
                    and to be financially free. Why I would want to be successful is because I want to run my life the way I just want to. I
                    also want to be financially free because as many people have this issue, a lot of people tend to have overdues, debts,
                    taxes, etc. I want to run my business without any hassle and no damage to the company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My strengths are that I am a team player, quick, honest, helpful, friendly, and I am also very creative. I am a team
                    player because if my team is behind or they are in a standpoint, I always pull through by putting in all my efforts into
                    helping the team and be on track. I am also very quick because if I find a problem I find them immediately rather than
                    thinking where it is. I am very honest because being honest allows us to bond and create strong communication between
                    everyone and my employees. I am very helpful because if someone has an issue, I try to help them even if I don’t have a
                    good answer because that helps everyone understand that you are a person who wants to help. Also, I am very friendly to
                    other people and don’t burst out in anger in case they do something wrong. I always help them even if it's their fault
                    or mine. Lastly I am very creative. I have many ideas to fix global warming but I don’t have the necessary materials to
                    do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have learned that teamwork is a very big factor in teams. Teamwork helps the team to bond and strengthen the work
                    ethics for everyone and not only me. I have also worked in tutoring centers and you have to learn that even if someone
                    is doing something wrong you should never burst out in anger. I had a tutor and he bursted out on me. I did not want to
                    go there and it changed my entire perspective about the tutoring center. I don’t wish to make other people feel bad
                    because one person ruined a person perspective of the center
                </p>
                <p>
                    My personal career wish is to run my own business that will solve a world problem. I have many strengths and I
                    understand the meaning of any objective pretty quickly. I also want to thank you for reading about me. Please feel free
                    to look at my other pages about projects and my resume showing all the experiences, skills, contact methods in detail.

                        This project resembles a fully functional game. It is quite known as well. It is called hangman and the game is also
                        based on the topic, Marvel. Why we did this is because there aren't many hangman games that looks visually pleasing and
                        they also don’t have functional parts. In our code we have colored text, text bolded to our disabled or people who need
                        to see it more clearer, and also instructions everytime you play it for the newcomers. This was fully python.
