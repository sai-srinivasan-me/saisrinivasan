                <p>
                    No one has had a life that is more challenging than mine yet I was able to still ram past the obstacles. I always want
                    to run my own business that fixes a world problem that everyone has been fighting to fix. My goals are to be successful
                    and to be financially free. Why I would want to be successful is because I want to run my life the way I just want to. I
                    also want to be financially free because as many people have this issue, a lot of people tend to have overdues, debts,
                    taxes, etc. I want to run my business without any hassle and no damage to the company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My strengths are that I am a team player, quick, honest, helpful, friendly, and I am also very creative. I am a team
                    player because if my team is behind or they are in a standpoint, I always pull through by putting in all my efforts into
                    helping the team and be on track. I am also very quick because if I find a problem I find them immediately rather than
                    thinking where it is. I am very honest because being honest allows us to bond and create strong communication between
                    everyone and my employees. I am very helpful because if someone has an issue, I try to help them even if I don’t have a
                    good answer because that helps everyone understand that you are a person who wants to help. Also, I am very friendly to
                    other people and don’t burst out in anger in case they do something wrong. I always help them even if it's their fault
                    or mine. Lastly I am very creative. I have many ideas to fix global warming but I don’t have the necessary materials to
                    do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have learned that teamwork is a very big factor in teams. Teamwork helps the team to bond and strengthen the work
                    ethics for everyone and not only me. I have also worked in tutoring centers and you have to learn that even if someone
                    is doing something wrong you should never burst out in anger. I had a tutor and he bursted out on me. I did not want to
                    go there and it changed my entire perspective about the tutoring center. I don’t wish to make other people feel bad
                    because one person ruined a person perspective of the center
                </p>
                <p>
                    



I am passionate about being a cybersecurity expert because I believe that cybersecurity is critical in today's digital age. As cyber attacks and data breaches become more common, I understand the importance of protecting sensitive data and critical infrastructure. Cybersecurity interests me because it offers an opportunity to use my technical skills and knowledge to help organizations stay secure. As a cyber security expert, I want to work on challenging and innovative projects involving risk management, threat analysis and incident response. I also believe that cybersecurity is an ever-evolving field, and I am excited to continue to learn and stay abreast of the latest technologies and best practices. Ultimately, I want to make a meaningful contribution to society by ensuring that individuals and organizations can conduct their digital activities confidently and securely.

                        In this project, we have tried to locate all vulnerabilities in the computer. In total we have located 5 major catagories of issues. The more prominant one is the FTP server and the Firewall being completely vulnerable. We did this project to practice skills to locating vulnerabilites through an unsafe computer. We rated each vulnerabilites to determine how risky each vulnerability is.

It also gave us a new understanding of how vulnerabilites can be formed when the client clarifies how they recieved the vulnerabilites.</li>

            <h2>Let's talk.</h2>
            <div class="container_fill_body">
                <p>During my time in high school I was able to get two jobs. I was able to be a substitute tutor for the corporation Code
                Ninjas and in that same company I also was a summer camp tutor. I taught the following classes, Roblox, Scratch, Python,
                and currently JavaScript Classes. I gained a lot of experience from these classes. I am now able to teach young children
                around the age of 7 - 14 and I can teach the efficiently. These classes essentially allowed me to know how others can
                think of coding and how I can change that without changing their full perspective of coding.</p>
                <p>I am planning on going into the CyberSecurity field so I am taking ROP Cybersecurity next year to abide by that. I will
                be using that class as a source of knowledge to build off my cybersecurity experience. Through that knowledge, I plan on
                going to college then taking a cybersecurity bootcamp to get into the cybersecurity field. Once I pass the bootcamp, I
                can either take more to build more skill and get more accreditation, or I can also skip and use my degree as my
                validation.</p>
